## Programming

The entire application is written in javascript. The back end is a node server that uses express for routing, passport and jwt for authentication, and mongoose as the database driver. The front end is an angular app and uses bootstrap for styling. The data is stored in a MongoDB database. Markdown processing is done using [this](https://github.com/VladimirV99/Markdown) library.

## Required software

- nodejs - JavaScript runtime environment
- npm - package manager for nodejs applications
- MongoDB - a NoSQL database program

## Environment variables

- NODE_ENV - Set to 'production' to use production mode
- PORT - Port to run the server on (default 3000)
- DB_HOST - Database connection URL (default 'mongodb://localhost:27017/blog')
- PASSPORT_SECRET - Key used for authentication (default 'blog')

## Starting the website

First start the mongodb server to run our databse

    sudo mongod --dbpath [path]
    
just replace [path] with the wanted path. You can access the database from the terminal

    mongo

Now you can start the back end server. It will automatically restart itself on when a file is changed

    npm run dev

and finally serve the angular front end

    npm run start --prefix client

You can now open the website on localhost:4200 in the browser. To close the app shut down the servers in the reverse order.

## Building for production

Build the client to get served from the back end server

    npm install --prefix client
    npm run prod --prefix client

or use the heroku postbuild script which will do the same

    npm run heroku-postbuild

then install server-side dependencies and start the server in production mode

    npm install
    env NODE_ENV=production npm run start

you can also set other environment variables to fit your environment
